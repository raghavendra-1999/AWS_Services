## Difference Between Ansible and Terraform
| Feature       | Terraform | Ansible |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Purpose | Infrastructure Provisioning | Configuration Management |
| State Management | Maintains state | Stateless |
| Declarative vs Imperative | Declarative | Procedural & Declarative |
| Cloud Agnostic | Yes | Yes |
| Agent-Based | No | No (Push-based) |
| Best Use Case | Creating resources | Configuring servers |

## Providers in Terraform
Terraform supports various cloud and on-premise providers, such as:
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- VMware
- Kubernetes
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

## Terraform Modules
Modules are reusable, self-contained Terraform configurations that help organize infrastructure efficiently. They:
- Reduce duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Allow easy scaling

## Outputs in Terraform
Terraform allows users to define output variables that expose computed values after execution. Outputs are useful for:
- Sharing data between modules
- Displaying infrastructure information
- Passing values to other tools

## Infrastructure Components
- **Private Network Space**: Terraform provisions isolated networks for security.
- **EC2 Server Instances**: Automates the creation and management of AWS EC2 instances.
- **Docker & Other Tools**: Integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, and other DevOps tools for seamless container management.
- **Security**: Implements IAM policies, security groups, and encryption for enhanced security.

## Terraform State
Terraform maintains a state file that stores infrastructure configurations and mappings. 
- **Local State**: Stored on the local machine.
- **Remote State**: Stored in S3, Terraform Cloud, or Scalr for better collaboration.
- **State Locking**: Prevents multiple users from making conflicting updates.

## Terraform Plan
Terraform Plan previews changes before applying them. It helps in:
- Identifying infrastructure changes
- Avoiding unintended modifications
- Ensuring correctness before deployment

## Imperative vs Declarative Approaches
Terraform follows a **declarative** approach, where the desired end state of infrastructure is defined, and Terraform automatically determines how to achieve it. 

### **Declarative Approach**
- Specifies **what** the final infrastructure should look like.
- Terraform computes the steps required to reach that state.
- Example: Writing a configuration that states "Create an S3 bucket," and Terraform ensures it exists.

### **Imperative Approach**
- Specifies **how** to achieve a result step-by-step.
- Users manually define each action required.
- Example: Writing scripts to manually create, configure, and update an S3 bucket.
